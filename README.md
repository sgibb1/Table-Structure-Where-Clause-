# Table-Structure-Where-Clause-

In this programming assignment you will be practicing how to properly structure a table and use where clauses.

Your finished product should be a link to a GitHub repository with 2 SQL files inside.

To complete the activity, you will need to do the following:

Schema File:

Refactor your previous schema file to add primary keys to each of your tables.
Add default and not null constraints to columns where it makes sense.
Seeds File:

Create a SQL File
Write SQL to insert multiple pieces of data into the tables created by your schema file
An ID should be added automatically with each piece of data inserted
Some inserts should use the default values you put in columns, some should overwrite the defaults
Write SQL to select certain rows with where clauses
